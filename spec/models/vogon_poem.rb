    %{Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
      Thy micturitions are to me,
      As plurdled gabbleblotchits,
      On a lurgid bee,
      That mordiously hath blurted out,
      Its earted jurtles,
      Into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer. [drowned out by moaning and screaming]
      Now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles,
      Are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts,
      And living glupules frart and slipulate,
      Like jowling meated liverslime,
      Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turling dromes,
      And hooptiously drangle me,
      With crinkly bindlewurdles,
      Or else I shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon,
      See if I don't.
